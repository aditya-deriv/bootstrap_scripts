# private_scripts

Description: simple bash script to install a bunch of applications on (ideally) a linux machine that's freshly out of the box or been recently formatted, edits can be made according to your taste too.

Before you do anything with my script, clone or download the bash .sh file and then make it executable.

To make it executable do a `chmod u+x adi_setup_script.sh` and then run it by going to it's directory on your local machine with cd and then execute using `./adi_setup_script.sh` command

See that it works, also you can replace `apt-get` with `brew` if using a mac, i shall make a new bash file for that eventually.
