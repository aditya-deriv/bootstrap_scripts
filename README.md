# private_scripts

Before you do anything with my script, clone or download the bash .sh file and then make it executable.

To make it executable do a `chmod u+x adi_setup_script.sh` and then run it by going to it's directory on your local machine with cd and then execute using `./adi_setup_script.sh` command

See that it works, also you can replace `apt-get` with `brew` if using a mac, i shall make a new bash file for that eventually.
